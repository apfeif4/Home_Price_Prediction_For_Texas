# 🏡 Home Price Predictions – Texas

## 📝 Overview

This project analyzes **Texas home price data** and uses **machine learning models** to predict property values.
We apply **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest Regression**, and **Support Vector Classification (SVC)** to model the data, along with a **word tokenizer** to analyze property descriptions for potential value indicators.

**Status:** ✅ Completed

## 🎯 Objectives

* Predict **future home values** based on historical data and property features.
* Compare performance across multiple machine learning algorithms.
* Explore whether **keywords in property descriptions** influence home prices.
* Create visualizations to better understand trends and model results.
